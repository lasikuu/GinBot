### Origin of the name

GinBot was originally named **TohsakaBot**, or **Rin** for the short-form, which is the name (ÈÅ†ÂùÇÂáõ) of one of the
heroines in the game Fate/stay night.
While the original version was written in Ruby, for the rewrite we chose to use Go, which brings us the name **GinBot** (Go+Rin).
